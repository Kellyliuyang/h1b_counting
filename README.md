# h1b_counting
Problem: Determine the top 10 occupations and top 10 states for certified visa applications.
Approach: I used python without refering to external library to determine the top 10 occupation and top 10 states.
Run instructions: execute run.sh.
Because github can't allow me to upload files greater than 25M, I just upload the testing h1b_input.csv in the input folder of the root directory.
Please put your input file into the input folder of the root directory to test.
